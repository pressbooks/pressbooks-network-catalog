## Installation

Run `composer require pressbooks/pressbooks-network-catalog` in your project bedrock.

## Frontend development

Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.

The project uses VITE and Tailwind JIT to compile the frontend assets. Run `npm run dev` to compile the assets and use hot reloading.

**To enable hot reloading:**

1. Set `IS_VITE_DEVELOPMENT` environment variable to `true` to enable the development server, located in the `pressbooks-netwotk-catalog.php` (main plugin file).

2. Run `npm run dev` this will watch for changes and recompile the assets using hot reloading.

## Build frontend assets

**If you've set up hot reloading, don't forget to revert `IS_VITE_DEVELOPMENT` to `false` in the `pressbooks-network-catalog.php` (main plugin file).**

Run `npm run build` to build the frontend assets.

## Run tests
Run `composer test` to run the tests.

## Lint coding standards
Run `composer standars` to run the tests.
